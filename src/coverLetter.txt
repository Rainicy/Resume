I am Bingyu Wang from Northeastern University in Boston. I am currently a 4rd-year PhD student in Computer Science. 

My research is focusing on Machine Learning/Data Mining, specifically on Multi-Label Classification problems, wherein a document/image contains multiple labels. For example, a twitter may be labeled by more than one tags or a image from Flickr represents more than one objects. Currently, I am working on modeling label dependencies and dealing with Extreme Multi-Label problems(extreme number of features, instances and labels). 

My works could be applied into 1) any classification problems involving more than one targets; 2) any recommendation systems, such as recommending multiple items to users based their profile; 3) any searching systems where you want to recommend relevant documents/images for usersâ€™ search. 

I am interested in any positions related to data science for summer internship in 2019.  And my availability is from May 1st to August 30th in 2019.

My research is focusing on Machine Learning/Data Mining, specifically on Multi-Label Classification problems, wherein a document/image contains multiple labels. For example, a news article may be related to more than one topic, e.g. both international and politics, or a picture on Instagram represents more than one objects. In particular, I am working on modeling dependencies within multiple labels and applying it on large-scale real-world data. 
My works could be applied to, but not limited to 1) real-world classification problems (documents/image), involving more than one label; 2) recommendation system, such as recommending multiple items to users based on their preferences; 3) searching system, for example, providing the most relevant documents or images given by users' search.
